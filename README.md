UFT is a fungible (ERC-20) token, a cryptocurrency, that supports Ukraine in its fight against the Russian aggression against Ukrainian people, their freedom, land and culture.

Core prinples:

1. All proceeds go towards vetted Ukrainian funds. Under 1% towards infrastructure and further development could be discussed for future grant-based R&D roadmap.
2. A fully functional yet simple crypto currency.
3. Limited supply (21m?)
4. Deflational mechanism.
5. Earlier participation is rewarded (time is of essense!)
6. Proceeds withdrawal can be triggered by anyone, but only to pre-defined & vetted charities, volunteers and NGO wallets. 
7. Coin can be interchangeable across other Ukraine-focused projects and coin holders should be able to receive benefits such as NFMT https://github.com/dappros/nfmt airdrops etc.
