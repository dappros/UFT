UFDT is a fungible (ERC-20) token, a cryptocurrency that supports Ukraine in its fair fight to protect Ukrainian people, their freedom, land and culture against Russian aggression. Ukraine is a bastion protecting European and world's democracy from barbarism, and UFDT reflects these values and mission.

## Core principles

1. All proceeds go towards vetted Ukrainian foundations such as for instance United24, Povernys Zhyvym or Corporation of Monsters. 
A small percentage towards infrastructure and further development could be discussed and decided by DAO for future grant-based R&D roadmap.
2. A fully functional yet simple crypto currency.
3. Limited supply (21 billion)
4. Deflational mechanism.
5. Earlier participation is rewarded (time is of essense!)
6. Proceeds withdrawal can be triggered by anyone, but only to pre-defined & vetted charities, volunteers and NGO wallets. 
7. Coin can be interchangeable across other Ukraine-focused projects. Coin holders should be able to receive benefits such as NFMT https://github.com/dappros/nfmt , airdrops etc. 

## Mission: 
1. Create DAO based financial fund supporting Ukraine. Our main objectives are to make it super easy to fund Ukraine with crypto, and also make decision making fast, decentralized and transparent.
2. Create an Ethereum / ERC-20 compatible crypto currency to support the above and facilitate transactions for Ukrainians and those who support them.

## Is the coin tradable and freely exchangeable?
Yes! (though this isnâ€™t the main goal of the project). Token contract is integrated with Uniswap decentralized exchange liquidity pool which allows any coin holder to trade it back to ETH at any time. Other trading pairs can also be set up by the community.

## Holding incentives: DAO voting, staking, NFT drops
Users are incentivised to hold the coin to facilitate democratic DAO voting and to raise more funding for the DAO grants. This is done via DAO vote privilege, automated staking and NFT drops for the benefit of coin holders.

## Funds distribution
100% of minting proceeds goes to DAO controlled fund.
All coin holders vote on funding proposals and the funds get released for withdrawal as soon as consensus is reached. As simple as that!

## Main flow 
1. Users mint the coin with ETH or purchase it at exchanges
2. Each owner has DAO votes and participates in decision making regarding the deployment of grants
3. More Coin you hold - more DAO votes you have
4. Grant proposals will be posted at the project website and also via the L2 wallet app

## Additional flow - L2 app
1. L2 wallet app for iOS/Android allows users to collaborate and vote around DAO funding proposals, attract new users and tip projects or other users (volunteers, artists) with coin.
2. Users can login via WalletConnect and thus verify the amount of DAO votes they have via mainnet wallet.
3. Users who don't invest still receive some coin for app activity, sharing cool messages, referrals etc. This way, social promoters and organizers are rewarded.
